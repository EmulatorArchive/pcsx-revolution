It's only a playground, so do not expect much.

# TODO #

Some planned works:

  * Speed up. I have some ideas how to speed it up, but it will take some time. (WIP)
  * Better UI. Only after speed up.

Known problems:

  * Rarely "Code dump" with "Show FPS" turned on. Not high priority, so just turn it off.
